DEMO8
The following figure shows a surface-wave tomography test. (a) Ray path between a pair of virtual source (red star) and station (blue triangle). The background is the 5 sec group velocities of the Australian continent from ambient noise imaging. (b) Travel time field. (c) Ray paths of all 25,899 pairs. (d)-(f) The same as (a)-(c) but for the initial model with a constant velocity.
